      "Woke up not feeling strong. Realized I forgot to plan for today. there’s supposed to be a big rainstorm and snow from Cleveland to Toledo tomorrow which gave me two options: bike to Sandusky, camp, then brave the horrible weather the following day or just bike 120 miles to Toledo all in one day. After staring at some weather maps for half an hour I said f*ck it and chose the latter. I did hop on the red line rta to cle Bc f*ck you. Anyways started from cle. Felt tired Bc I kept waking up in the night plus I didn’t eat too much the previous night shoutout to Zoe for the chicken though. Biked route 6 along lake eerie. Lots of big ass houses. Stopped in Lorain for a god subway sub. Continued smashing miles until like 8 miles out from Huron. Ran over some sharp metal and got a flat. Spent two hours trying to fix it. Bernie, the bike homie who hooked me up with my extra inner tubes gave me ones that were too big. Was definitely feeling the bern. Had to patch the tires. Repatched my tube at least three times before realizing that the little piece of metal had cut both sides of my tube. After fixing that I continued on my way. Had to pump up every mile or so Bc patches are weak. Fell asleep at some random Dairy Queen by mistake. Got to Huron. Had no clue of what to do. Still had 65+ miles to go and it was already 5. I’m paying for the cheapest data plan so I can’t like set routes or look for bike shops unless I’m on WiFi so I found some cafe and wasted half an hour trying to figure out what to do. Decided I was gonna bike to dicks in Sandusky to get a new tube. Biked to dicks. A bro helped me out. Bought a strong headlight. South Sandusky smells like butt. Stopped in a McDonald’s. Deposited a large load in their toilet.Then began my 62 mile ride to Toledo in the dark. I’ve never biked more than 85 miles before. I didn’t really train for this either but honestly it wasn’t that bad. I bumped music. Raced a train and won. Got 5$ pizza at Fremont. Called Jan, a paramedic I used to work with who introduced me to 5$ pizza. He actually was actually like a yard away from the dudes when a man get popped in the face at ummc. He’s a huge dad and bought me food and stuff in the struggle days. Thanked Jan. My headlight was jumpin with lumens. Saw tons of cats. Arrived to Toledo at 1."

Saw lots of Amish people. Ate joys lunch under a Walgreens overhang. Started biking again but thunder and lighting started coming down so I chilled in a McDonald’s for two hours to wait out the rain. Had the saddest 1$ hamburger. Met this woman in the McDonald’s that was trying to solve a Rubik’s cube. I told her that there are algorithms that smart people figured out for the cube. She insisted that because she had figured out sudoku herself that she could solve a cube by herself. Good luck McDonald’s lady. Biked the rest of the way to case at 2. Encountered lots of hills. Will the pizza guy from yesterday said that Ohio was flat. The only thing flat about today was the Fanta I had at McDonald’s. Got to case. Engaged in some dummy behavior. Met some cool dudes. Went on a nature walk."

      "Left Wyatt’s house at 8. Almost perished Bc I was biking on a skinny path next to the road and my left pannier bumped into a telephone phone that sent me into oncoming traffic. Car swerved barely missing me, smh. Got to this bridge but it was closed so I had to take a 5 mile detour up a mountain. Google maps bike trail api or whatever wrecked me as well and took me to a highway with no side room for me to bike. Had to walk two miles on the other side of the impact barrier. So many bushes and trash. Got to this rusty staircase that went down to train tracks and a road. Was done with walking so I moved my bike on the staircase. I had to stand on the impact barrier and lift my bike over the rail as shown on pic two. Then I had to push through all the branches and stuff on the stairs while carrying my bike and stuff. Once I cleared that I felt invincible. Crushed the rest of the trip. Met a nice guy named will who bought me a pizza. Love you will. Secured pizza box with my jacket and finished it in Youngstown. Staying in joys house. She’s a nice mom and professor. Saw lots road kill at least."

My legs are super sore and the ligaments under my knee hurt so bad. Anyways, my ass. In the shower chunks of skin were peeling off. It’s literally like a huge exposed blister with a big bruise underneath. Gonna stay awhile to heal. That’s what I get for literally doing no training 🤡.

Biked on the rail trail a bit only to realize it was a dead end. Had to Ford a creek and to get back to the regular c&o trail. Stopped in paw paw for lunch. Nice town besides all the track marks and sunken eyes. Enjoyed my chicken tendies. Met a fellow gap year clown who was walking to California. She was pushing a stroller with googly eyes. Her name was jin or gin. The name of her cart thing was faith. Gotta look her up sometime Bc I said I would. Discovered that I like going on top of tunnel entrances. Elevation gang. Arrived to Cumberland around 7. Chilled in Wendy’s for an hour charging my gear. Ate a disgusting salad. Decided I wanted to try as many sodas as I can on this trip. It was getting dark around the time I left Cumberland. The trail was absolute shit. With the rain making everything soft and sand(?) on the trail, I couldn’t bike at all in the dark. Had to walk my bike for like 5 miles. Almost fell asleep while walking. Decided I would camp at the next open spot on the side of the trail. Found a viewpoint of mt savage and called it a night. "

      "Woke up this morning at 0900. Shout out to Katherine for the amazing chocolate chip waffles. Went over to fspace (a makerspace/hackerspace/glorified Orion storage area) to move tables over to our new location on market. After that, I went over to the Frederick Fairgrounds to help out my boy Matt and his dad set up their booth for the upcoming gun show. I left Frederick at 1330. It rained the whole day. By the time I got to Williamsport I was soaked and tired after biking over a couple “mountains”. However I was optimistic, the c&o towpath was flat so I was looking forward to crushing the next 40 miles easy. I was wrong. I got fucked. When I got to the trailhead the entire direction in which I needed to go was under construction. There were detour signs but I wanted to save time so I just went around all the fences and walked straight through it. Upon clearing the construction site I was greeted by a huge mud pit, one that took me 30 minutes to trudge through. By the time I got through it was already getting dark. And so began the worst night of my life. I biked the next 40 miles in pitch black darkness. the little led flashlight Zoe had gifted me was stuck in a strobe light mode so I shoved it into my pocket. I went insane around 2100 and came back around 2200. Biking completely alone in a dark trail with 4000+ miles ahead of you is an interesting experience. Besides the crushing loneliness, the physical discomfort from the still pouring rain and the itching regret, I was expecting 5 naked hillbilly crackheads to jump out of the woods and destroy me at any moment. What a night. I stopped at a place called Hancock for water at midnight. met some nice rednecks who wanted to trade their car for my helmet. I said I voted for Obama and they ran away. Finished biking at 330am. Finally slept at 4am. I wanted to quit so bad but I knew I had to set the tone for myself for the rest of the trip so I’m glad I had a rainy, muddy, and shitty first day."

      "Departed 12 hours late today. Spent the morning commuting back to Baltimore after borrowing Elaine’s car to move my couch to Ron’s dorm at around 1am. Once I got back to my apt, I spent the rest of the day cleaning to ensure that my safety deposit (food money) would be returned in full. Left Baltimore around 545pm and decided I would be staying at fspace for the night. Met a couple bikers on my way out, one was a kind biker with red panniers. My doubts amplified as the sun set. Biked in the dark for a while. Just as I was leaving mt airy around 1130pm, Katherine looked at my location and saw I was biking in the dark so she came and picked me up 😂. Ended up sleeping at the Bukis instead of at fspace. "
